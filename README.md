# Hydroxychloroquine, Covid-19 And This Repository

This repository is intended to catalog available research on the effectiveness of HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine) on the treatment for Covid-19.

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> This is not intended to have any political bias or commentary, just links to the available research for anyone interested.
> 
> This should **NOT** be considered, at any point, a complete catalog of all research available. This is just a personal effort done on our spare time.
> 
> The decision to use or not HCQ should come from doctors and specialists and not random people on the internet. The objective of this repository is **NOT** to serve as a recomendation or not of use of the medication, but as an easy way to locate and read research on the subject.
> 
> Also, please, news website links are not research.

## Structure

Each research added to this document should have:

- Link to the research.
- Date in which the research was published.
- Small summary of the conclusion of the research.
- Bias of the conclusion relative to how effective HCQ is against Covid-19: effective, not effective or inconclusive.

Example:

**[Title Of The Research](http://someurl.com/the-research)**  
**Published:** 5/1/2020  
**Summary:** The results could not provide us with a clear picture on whether HCQ is effective or not on the treatment against Covid-19.  
**Bias:** Inconclusive.

> **ABOUT THE SUMMARY**
> 
> The summary should be short but have enough information to convey what the conclusion of the research was.
> 
> However, it is recommended to **READ THE RESEARCH** instead of relying on the summary. If the summary does not match the research, **PLEASE LET US KNOW** by creating an issue.

> **ABOUT THE BIAS**
> 
> The bias should not be used as the only source of analysis for the effectiveness of HCQ against Covid-19.
> 
> It is only there to provide a general idea of the conclusion of the research while disregarding specfics of the same. An ideal conclusion should come from reading the entirety of each research and understanding the specific case considered in it.
> 
> The raio of 'effective' vs 'not effective' bias should **NOT** be used as a basis for recomendation, since it would ignore the details, scope and limitiations of each research.

# Covid-19 Research

Below is the research in this catalog, specific to Covid-19, so far. Newest research comes first.

**[Should Clinicians Use Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine Alone or in Combination With Azithromycin for the Prophylaxis or Treatment of COVID-19?](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1998)**  
**Published:** 5/13/2020  
**Summary:** Pratice points related to the use of HCQ or HCQ+AZ for prevention and treatment against Covid-19. Sumarizes available evidence and recomends against the use of both treatments for both cases.  
**Bias:** Not effective.  

**[Association of Treatment With Hydroxychloroquine or Azithromycin With In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York State](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766117)**  
**Published:** 5/11/2020  
**Summary:** Study of 1,438 cases in New York showed no significant improvement in mortality rate between patients using HCQ, azithromycin and HCQ+AZ and patients not using the treatment.  
**Bias:** Not effective.  

**[Observational Study of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2012410)**  
**Published:** 5/7/2020  
**Summary:** Study of 1,376 cases in New York showed no significant connection betweem usage of HCQ and a reduction of intubation or detah rates. Patients who received HCQ treatment where more severily ill at baseline.   
**Bias:** Not effective.

**[Baseline use of hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/07/annrheumdis-2020-217690)**  
**Published**: 5/7/2020  
**Summary:** The regular usage of HCQ by patients with lupus did not seem to impede infection by Covid-19 on the same patients. The numbers of patients infected and that needed intense care did not differ between people who don't use HCQ and people who do use it.  
**Bias:** Not effective.  

**[Hydroxychloroquine in patients with mainly mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019: open label, randomised controlled trial](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1849)**  
**Published:** 5/6/2020  
**Summary:** The use of HCQ did not seem to significantly improve results on patients with mild to moderate Covid-19. Patients using HCQ had more adverse events.  
**Bias:** Not effective.  

**[Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-27223/v1)**  
**Published**: 5/6/2020  
**Summary:** The usage of HCQ on non-humans did show any antiviral activity, regardless of timming after infection. The results do not support HCQ as an antiviral agent against Covid-19 on humans.  
**Bias:** Not effective.  

**[Clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen: observational comparative study using routine care data](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1844.abstract)**  
**Published:** 5/5/2020  
**Summary:** The study do not support the use of HCQ for patients of Covid-19 who require oxygen.  
**Bias:** Not effective.  

**[Early treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: A retrospective analysis of 1061 cases in Marseille, France](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302179)**  
**Published:** 5/5/2020  
**Summary:** The usage of HCQ+AZ on the early stages of Covid-19 seems safe and associated to a low fatality rate.  
**Bias:** Effective.  

**[Risk of QT Interval Prolongation Associated With Use of Hydroxychloroquine With or Without Concomitant Azithromycin Among Hospitalized Patients Testing Positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2765631)**  
**Published:** 5/1/2020  
**Summary:** Covid-19 patients using HQC and HQC+AZ were in higher risk of QTc prolongation. Clinicians should be aware of this risk when considering HCQ or HCQ+AZ treatments.  
**Bias:** Inconclusive. Might cause serious adverse events.

**[Assessment of QT Intervals in a Case Series of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection Treated With Hydroxychloroquine Alone or in Combination With Azithromycin in an Intensive Care Unit](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2765633)**
