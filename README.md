# Hydroxychloroquine, Covid-19 And This Repository

This repository is intended to catalog available research on the effectiveness of HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine) on the treatment for Covid-19.

    IMPORTANT

    This is not intended to have any political bias or commentary, just links to the available research for anyone interested.

    This should **NOT** be considered, at any point, a complete catalog of all research available. This is just a personal effort done on our spare time.

    The decision to use or not HCQ should come for doctors and specialists and not random people on the internet. The objective of this repository is **NOT** to serve as a recomendation or not of use of the medication, but as an easy way to locate and read research on the subject.

    Also, please, news website links are not research.

## Other Languages

This document is also available in other langagues.

- [English - US](README.md)
- [PortuguÃªs - Brasil](README.pt-br.md)

Even though this document may be in different languages, the research and titles will not be translated.

## Structure

Each research added to this document should have:

- Link to the research.
- Date in which the research was published.
- Small summary of the conclusion of the research.
- Bias of the conclusion relative to how effective HCQ is against Covid-19: effective, not effective or inconclusive.

Example:

**[Title Of The Research](http://someurl.com/the-research)**  
**Published:** 5/1/2020  
**Summary:** The results could not provide us with a clear picture on whether HCQ is effective or not on the treatment against Covid-19.  
**Bias:** Inconclusive.

The summary should be short but have enough information to convey what the conclusion of the research was.

However, it is recommended to **READ THE RESEARCH** instead of relying on the summary. If the summary does not match the research, **PLEASE LET US KNOW** by creating an issue.

# Research

Below is the research in this catalog, so far. Newest research comes first.

[Baseline use of hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/07/annrheumdis-2020-217690)  
**Published**: 5/7/2020  
**Summary:** The regular usage of HCQ by patients with lupus did not seem to impede infection by Covid-19 on the same patients. The numbers of patients infected and that needed intense care did not differ between people who don't use HCQ and people who do use it.  
**Bias:** Not effective.

[Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-27223/v1)  
**Published**: 5/6/2020  
**Summary:** The usage of HCQ on non-humans did show any antiviral activity, regardless of timming after infection. The results do not support HCQ as an antiviral agent against Covid-19 on humans.  
**Bias:** Not effective.
